# Rubik-Cube-Solver
Key Learnings from the project:
We learned how to take a real world object, like a Rubik’s Cube, and model it into something that the computer can understand.
We learned how to take a larger problem, like the complete Rubik’s Cube solver, and break it down into smaller problems, using basic models and controllers, that is, Rubik’s cube representations and solvers.
We learned how to break down multiple representations into classes and create base classes that can be further extended. Namely, creating Rubik’s Cube base class and Pattern Database Base class.
We also learned many practical examples of Object-Oriented Programming in use, like the following:
Classes and Objects
Virtual Functions and Abstract Classes
Inheritance
Operator Overloading
We learned how path finding algorithms like BFS, DFS, IDDFS and IDA* can be used to solve real world problems related to AI. Many more problems in the field of AI can be solved using these algorithms.
We learned about the concept of Heuristic Search Algorithms like A* and IDA* and how Pattern Databases can be created to provide that heuristic.
Miscellaneous things we learned along the way:
How unordered_map<> works for custom objects
How to create custom hash functions
How bits can be used to store information
How to save and load files
The basic idea of Black boxing, where we can give an input and expect a certain output from the Black Box (in our case, the Permutation Indexer)
